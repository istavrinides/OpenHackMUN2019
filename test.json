The hotel (apartments) boasts a 5 star 5 diamond \n\nlabel but probably needs some sprucing up to really merit that. For example, the elevator - sized like \n\na coffin - in the building adjacent to the main building has an old worn out carpet and has short jerky \n\nmovements and gets filled quickly resulting in waits at the ground level. On check-in the receptionist \n\npromised various newspapers the next morning besides the complimentary Independent only to find \n\nNOTHING delivered. The Independent did arrive on the second morning. The breakfast room is tiny \n\nand gets filled in rapidly on weekends with the staff valiantly trying to keep guests seated and served \n\nbut usually is unable to cope - example: cappuccino ordered showed up tepid and luke warm. \n\nEvidently it came from some place far away (probably the hotel next door which management does \n\nlittle to let on that it is part of the same ownership).

            "content": "\nLucky I didn't listen to negative reviews! \n\nThe Park Hotel, New York, USA \n\n11/22/2018 \n\nI almost cancelled my reservation for this hotel prior to my departure after reading the many \n\nnegative reviews here but given the great price for 5 nights at just US$1,300 including taxes , I took \n\nthe risk. After working for a week in LA, I went to New York for a bit of a break before heading back \n\nto Melbourne. It has been 13 years since my last visit there.After reading the many negative reviews, \n\nI prepared for the worst. I entered this large hotel and found the reception area nice, clean and \n\nspacious and the reception staff were very courteous and welcoming. Could this be the same hotel I \n\nwas reading about on Trip Advisor? They gave me my room key for the 17th floor and I was very \n\nnervous as I entered the key to open the door. I thought, how bad can the room be? To my shocked \n\nsurprise, the room was bigger than what I thought. The king size bed was massive, the widescreen \n\nTV was great and the room smelled nice. One last check was the bathroom and, lo and behold, not \n\none trace of fungus or odour and, for New York and for a single, it was big enough.I will definitely be \n\nstaying at this hotel again but I will be sure to get the same room as I heard other rooms on the \n\nlower levels may not be as nice. Given the rate, this hotel was a steal and the location was perfect. It \n\nwas great to leave the hotel at 7.30pm and walk just five minutes to a Broadway play starring Bill \n\nPullman and Julia Stiles starting at 8pm. Heaven! Only in New York! \n\nReviewer: Delia Barrera \n\n\n",

The receptionist seemed to be expecting our complaint and moved us the next day. \n\nThe source of the noise is a huge air conditioning unit belonging to another hotel.

Both times we were in \n\na one bedroom suite. The suite consists of a separate bedroom with a king bed, flat screen TV, \n\ncloset, plenty of drawers and a bathroom with tub and shower. Then there is a separate living room \n\nwith a TV, an eating area, a mini kitchen and another bathroom with a shower. There is daily maid \n\nservice, good towels and bath amenities. We were on the 25th floor with an east view and windows \n\nthat opened. The decor is functional, mid-level but clean and more than adequate. On our stay the \n\nelevators were running and our limited staff encounters were also fine. I read the mixed reviews. I \n\nknow they were having elevator problems but they are now ok. Of course, the location is the best. \n\nEasy walking distance to MOMA, Lincoln Center, Metropolitan Museum, Central Park, Whole Foods, \n\netc. Plenty of restaurants in walking distance and easy subway and bus access. \n\nReviewer: Leanne Cooper \n\n\n",

I'd certainly stay there again.I've \n\nstayed in several budget/tourist hotels in London over the years, and this was definitely one of the \n\nbetter ones. My (single) room was spotlessly clean, with a flat screen TV and new bathroom. It was \n\non the small side but this is to be expected in London budget hotels. One of it's little quirks was that I \n\nhad to run the shower for a couple of minutes to get hot water in the morning. The odd thing was \n\nthat the hot water in the sink came on straight away! My room was at the back on the third floor so \n\nnoise from outside wasn't a problem, although I noticed that the walls were pretty thin - I could hear \n\nthe people next door if they raised their voices.The Breakfast area was bright and recently \n\ndecorated. Breakfast consisted of juices, teabags and instant coffee, cereal, white and brown sliced \n\npan (toasters available), croissants, cheese, fruit and some tempting pastries.The location is not bad, \n\njust off the Cromwell Road. It's a few minutes walk away from Gloucester Road and Earl's Court Tube \n\nStations. The Natural History Museum, Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museums are a \n\n10-15 min. walk away. Hyde Park is a little further. \n\nReviewer: Hsiung Chuang \n\n\n",
